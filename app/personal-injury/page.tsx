          <h2>Auto, Pedestrian, Motorcycle and Bicycle Accidents</h2>
          <p>
            If you are injured in an accident in an automobile, on a Motorcycle,
            on a bicycle or as a pedestrian, you should seek immediate medical
            attention. As soon as possible, you should obtain information from
            all people involved in the accident including their name, address,
            phone number, and insurance information. You should immediately
            contact the police and have them prepare a traffic collision report.
            It is also very important to get the name, address and phone number
            of anyone who may have witnessed the accident. You should take
            pictures of the damage to any vehicle and any visible bodily injury.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you have obtained as much information as possible at the scene
            of the accident, immediately contact the Hosharian Law Firm.
            Insurance companies want to pay you as little as possible, and they
            will take advantage of you if they know you are not represented by
            an attorney. The quicker you contact your attorney, the greater your
            chances of success.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our staff will immediately report your case to the appropriate
            insurance companies. We will assist you in obtaining the best
            possible value for the damage to your vehicle, your pain and
            suffering, your loss of earnings and earning capacity, your loss of
            consortium and your emotional distress.
          </p>
          <h2>Slip and Fall</h2>
          <p>
            If you are the victim of a slip and fall accident, you should
            immediately seek medical attention. As soon as possible, you should
            report your fall to the owner/manager of the property on which you
            were injured. You should inspect and take a picture of whatever it
            was that caused you to fall. It is also very important to get the
            name, address, and number of the establishment where you were
            injured and any independent witnesses.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you have obtained as much information as possible at the scene
            of the accident, immediately contact the Hosharian Law Firm.
            Insurance companies want to pay you as little as possible and they

          <h2>Medical Malpractice</h2>
          <p>
            Hosharian Law handles a wide variety of medical malpractice claims.
            Medical Malpractice occurs when the medical service of any medical
            professional falls below the accepted standard of care for his or
            her field of medicine. Medical malpractice law is extremely complex
            and very expensive which is why most personal injury attorneys do
            not handle medical malpractice cases. In the last decade, Hosharian
            Law has successfully litigated a multitude of medical malpractice
            cases including malpractice in the areas of child-birth, botched
            surgeries, misdiagnosis or failure to diagnose, dangerous
            prescriptions, failure to prescribe, negligent supervision, wrongful
            death, and many more.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you believe you are a victim of Medical Malpractice, please
            contact Hosharian Law for a free consultation. We urge you to do
            this as soon as possible as there are usually impending deadlines to
            file lawsuits in these types of cases.
