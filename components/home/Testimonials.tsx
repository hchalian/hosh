      'I am more than happy to comment about attorney Peter Hosharian. I had the pleasure of trying a jury trial with him in Compton in June of 2011. We were able to achieve a not guilty result for our client who was facing 15 years to life. Mr. Hosharian is extremely prepared with a keen eye for relevant details of a case. His ability to work hard while being a tenacious defender was instrumental in achieving the acquittal for our client. I noticed the great care that Mr. Hosharian demonstrated time and time again for the well-being of out client. He is a very special attorney and I would not hesitate to recommend him to anyone in need',

    testimonial:
      "I had the pleasure of trying a civil case with Peter Hosharian. As lead counsel it's always difficult to find someone you can rely on and trust to be by your side in the courtroom for complex cases. Thankfully, Peter is just that kind of lawyer. Smart, reliable, and clever, Peter has all the tools of a true trial lawyer. In the fast-paced world of trial law, it's imperative for an attorney to be able to think on his or her feet, and I found myself impressed with what Peter brought to the table. I would be happy to work with him again in the future.",
